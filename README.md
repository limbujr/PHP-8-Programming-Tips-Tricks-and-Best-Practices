**A practical guide to PHP 8 features, usage changes, and advanced programming techniques**


## What is this book about?

Thanks to its ease of use, PHP is a highly popular programming language used on over 78% of all web servers connected to the Internet. PHP 8 Programming Tips, Tricks, and Best Practices will help you to get up-to-speed with PHP 8 quickly. The book is intended for any PHP developer who wants to become familiar with the cool new features available in PHP 8, and covers areas where developers might experience backward compatibility issues with their existing code after a PHP 8 update. The book thoroughly explores best practices, and highlights ways in which PHP 8 enforces these practices in a much more rigorous fashion than its earlier versions.

You'll start by exploring new PHP 8 features in the area of object-oriented programming (OOP), followed by enhancements at the procedural level. You'll then learn about potential backward compatible breaks and discover best practices for improving performance. The last chapter of the book gives you insights into PHP async, a revolutionary new way of programming, by providing detailed coverage and examples of asynchronous programming using the Swoole extension and Fibers.

By the end of this PHP book, you'll not only have mastered the new features, but you'll also know exactly what to watch out for when migrating older PHP applications to PHP 8.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Gain a comprehensive understanding of the new PHP 8 object-oriented features
* Discover new PHP 8 procedural programming enhancements
* Understand improvements in error handling in PHP 8
* Identify potential backward compatibility issues
* Avoid traps due to changes in PHP extensions
* Find out which features have been deprecated and/or removed in PHP 8
* Become well-versed with programming best practices enforced by PHP 8
